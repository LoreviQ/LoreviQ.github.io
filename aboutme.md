### Skills

-   Strong programming ability. Experience with:
    -   JavaScript which was the primary programming language used in my employment at The Curve Group, where I made extensive modifications to Microsoft Dynamics.
    -   Python which I used for physics/maths scripts, and for programming machine learning algorithms
    -   Java and C which I used for a variety of programming projects while at university
-   Familiarity with a wide range of operating systems used for both work and personal use. I use a mixture of Windows and Linux on my personal machine, and have a variety of Virtual machines with different implementations of Linux which I use for work.
-   Experience with a wide range of cyber-security topics due to attending summer Cyberfirst academies, such as networking, different operating systems and their security, cryptography, OSINT and more.
-   Excellent problem solving ability, with experience in physics problem solving for university and programming problems as a hobby.
-   Exceptional presentation skills. Presenting projects in front of an audience is something Iâ€™ve had to do many times at university and is one of my strengths. At The Curve Group I frequently had to present the status of projects to the COO and heads of relevant parts of the business.
-   The ability to self manage, organise and research independently. This was imperative at The Curve Group since we were a small self-managed team; as well as necessary for keeping up with university work and my own projects.
-   Strong ability for team working, experienced in working in a small team to manage projects and when I represented my school at the UK Maths Challenge team competition.
