### Employment History

**2023 - Current Day: Unemployed/Sabbatical**

After gaining valuable experience at The Curve Group, I took a deliberate gap year to focus on personal and professional development. During this time, I traveled to broaden my horizons and worked on advancing my skills in software development, particularly in areas that align with my passion for programming and cutting-edge technologies. This period of self-reflection and growth has equipped me with a stronger technical foundation and a renewed focus on pursuing opportunities in software development and programming.

- Took a sabbatical to travel and see the world while still young, gaining a broader perspective on global cultures
- Focused on self-directed learning and development in software development and programming, with a particular emphasis on Golang, Crypto and full-stack development.
- Completed personal projects such as WebNovelClient, a full stack project explained [in this blog post](https://www.oliver.tj/2024-08-16-WebNovelPlatform/)
- Used the time to deepen my expertise in technologies such as, Golang, React and CI/CD aligning my skills with my long-term career goals in software development.
